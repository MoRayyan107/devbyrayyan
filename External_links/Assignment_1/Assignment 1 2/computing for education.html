While taking immediate action is a very necessary task, it may be argued that education on
the topic of climate change could be of equal importance in the long run. 
By Providing better education on the topic of climate change and what we can 
do to support the cause, people become able to make better informed decisions
regarding their actions and may be personally driven to do their best to support the cause 
and reduce the damages that climate change and global warming can have on our environment.

<h2>E-Learning platforms</h2>
Online platforms such as educational websites and applications provide a very wide array of 
knowledge for the public to consume with ease, many of these sites will also offer the 
opportunity of online webinars and courses designed to develop the students understanding of 
climate change and sustainability issues. Another advantage of this is the student van choose course
tailored to their age range or  prior knowledge level, a 14-year-old interested in why the summers
are getting warmer will have a vastly different requirement of complexity than a fully grown adult looking 
to learn what they can do to help combat these issues. (Chang, Chew Hung. (2014).)

<h2>Data Visualisation</h2>
Technology now allows the creation of interesting and informative data visualisations such as interactive maps and graphs that demonstrate to the user specific trends related to climate change and global warming. These visual displays help the users grasp the scale of the issues and gain a better understanding of the problems and whatâ€™s causing them.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Online communities and forums</h2>
Computing and associated technologies provide places for open discussions and for curious people to quickly receive answers to questions they may have surrounding climate change. They also bring the opportunity for collaboration amongst like-minded individuals looking to broaden their mind. 
</p>
<p>
<h2>Interactive educational games</h2>
A more engaging way for some to learn may be via playing educational games specifically targeted at those looking to lean more about climate change. This provides the user with entertainment to maintain their engagement but also provides useful information. This is especially effective with younger audiences who may not have the attention span to sit and read articles and would much prefer to be stimulated by a game whilst learning simultaneously
