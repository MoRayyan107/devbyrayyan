              The most important international cause was held during the 1980s, 
              to reduce the damage on earth's ozone layer by decreasing the emission 
              of chlorofluorocarbons.

            <b>Ozone</b> is formed in the <b>stratosphere</b>, 
            concentration at <b>15-30 km</b> above the surface of the Earth and helps 
            in protecting us from the UV radiation from reaching its earth's 
            surface and us on exposure on <b>UV rays</b> which causes Skin 
            Cancer and other damages to living things on earth. Our atmosphere is 
            fragile as given evidence by yearly ozone hole over Antarctica.

            The <b>CFCs</b> so-called the Ozone depleting substances were used in refrigerants
            and aerosol cans and were emitted out causing the first Ozone depletion in
            the year 1989. further in the year 2011 there was a large amount of depletion 
            of Ozone. Scientists used <b>satellites</b> to predict their future behaviour.

            Satellites have been monitoring the Ozone layer using the European satellites 
            like <b>MetOp, ERS-2 and Envisat,</b> which records the data and gets delivered to the 
            scientists.

            The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment, or GOME-2, is an instrument carried by 
            EUMETSAT's Metop-A which was launched in 2006 and Metop-B (2012) satellites, which 
            are in a sun-synchronous polar orbit about 817 km above the Earth's surface and are 
            specifically designed to measure ozone in the atmosphere.

              Since 1979, satellite observations of the total ozone column, or the entire thickness 
              of the ozone layer, have been the main source of daily observations on a worldwide scale 
              for ozone layer monitoring.

          <p class ="paragraph">
              The total ozone column, however, doesn't reveal anything regarding how ozone changes with
              height. The latter is crucial because it determines when and how ozone depletion occurs as 
              well as the anticipated location of the first recovery signs. Additionally, altitude determines 
              how climate influences stratospheric ozone.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class ="paragraph">
              The way that ozone varies with altitude can be observed using a variety of methods. The vertical 
              distribution of ozone can also be determined by using downward-facing satellites and their instruments, 
              especially those that measure reflected visible and ultraviolet solar radiation, like OMI,
