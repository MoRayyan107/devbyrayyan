              <b>The Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer</b> for 
              Atmospheric Cartography <b>(SCIAMACHY)</b> 
              is an Imaging spectrometer which their primary object to was to 
              perform global measurements to trace gases from 
              stratosphere and troposphere. It calculates its 
              Measurements in form of wavelengths range between 
              <b>240 nm to 2400 nm</b>. The goal of SCIAMACHY was to 
              advance our understanding of a wide range of topics 
              crucial to the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere 
              (the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere) and possible 
              alterations brought about by either natural or man-made phenomena, including:

            The measurements from SCIAMACHY made it possible to investigate a variety of phenomena that affect atmospheric chemistry:

          <b>•	Measurements of aerosols:</b><br>SCIAMACHY's wide wavelength range made it the perfect 
          tool for figuring out what kind of aerosols are in the atmosphere. The polarization data obtained 
          from the <b>PMDs (polarization measurement devices)</b> helped with this analysis.

          <b>•	Measurements of clouds:</b><br>O2, O4, and CO2 absorptions in nadir viewing provide information 
          about light penetration in the atmosphere and, consequently, an estimate of the cloud top height. 
          The cloud top height is also obtained by combining PMDs data. SCIAMACHY made it easy to measure 
          <b>Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs)</b>, which are crucial to the ozone depletion process.
