            <h1>Intro</h1>
            <p> One of the main areas being impacted by climate change is our Ocean: the sea is heating up;
                the ice caps are melting; marine life is dying, and islands of rubbish are being formed.
                However, with the ever-advancing technologies of today solutions are being found which will
                be able to aid in the reduction of the effects of climate change on our oceans.</p>
            <h1>Oceans heating up</h1>
            <div class="sideimages">
                <img src="Group3Images/NA heating graph.png" alt="img">
                </div>
            <p>Our oceans are rapidly heating up at a faster rate than ever before and we need to do
                something about it before irreparable damage is done to our planet. In particular the North
                Atlantic Ocean has been heating up at an insane rate currently compared to every other ocean.
                This was initially quite confusing to experts in the field, as they expect the temperature to
                increase for normal reasons such as greenhouse gases trapping the heat from the sun in our
                atmosphere, but this would not lead to this sharp of an increase in temperature in only one
                specific ocean. This made researchers start to think about what may be causing this and an
                area they were correct in researching was the trails given off by ships and planes over the
                ocean.</p>
            <p></p>NASA scientists used artificial intelligence-based image recognition technology on 20 years
                worth of data from their Ailing Terra satellites. They used this artificial intelligence to look at
                the clouds formed by the ships and planes and the way they have changed over the years.
                They discovered that the clouds produced in recent years stay around for much less time and
                don’t interact with natural clouds in the same way anymore because of the regulatory changes
                in what is allowed to be in their fuels. They found that the main cause of these changes in the
                clouds is the reduction in sulfur content of fuel “Regulations imposed in 2020 by the United
                Nations’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) have cut ships’ sulfur pollution by more
                than 80% and improved air quality worldwide.”(Voosen, 2023) This reduction in sulfur is
                great for air quality and the general health of the planet however an unintended side effect of
                this is that sulphate particles from the old fules are no longer seeding in low lying clouds
                which were making them more reflective. These clouds being less reflective now is making it
                so more heat from the sun is able to make it directly to the ocean heating it up at an alarming
                rate.</p>
            <p>Solutions to this are still in the works but preliminary tests are showing that by injecting
                clouds with salt particles to make them more reflective might help slow this heating of the
                ocean so we can find better solutions before we are past the tipping point of global warming</p>
            <h1>Litter in our oceans</h1>
            <div class="sideimages">
                <img src="Group3Images/ocean plastic.jpeg" alt="img">
                </div>
            <p>Litter in our oceans is a major concern for the climate because it means that more plastic
                needs to be manufactured leading to even more greenhouse gases being released into our
                atmosphere. Just telling people to “stop littering,” is not doing enough as islands of plastic as
                as large as the state of Texas are forming in our ocean (Pyrek, 2016). A solution that many
                have come up with is using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to clean the ocean of
                marine plastics, and while this works well on a small scale, we have been struggling to make
                it work in a large scale operation.</p>
            <p> Researchers from Westlake University, Hangzhou have been coming up with a way in which
                many AUV’s can work together to clear areas of the ocean, but this is particularly difficult as
                the conditions for communication are not ideal. These researchers have come up with a
                reliable multi-robot task alocation (MRTA) model, which will make it so communication
                between multiple AUVs is not needed for a large scale operation. In this model, there is a
                controlling center which the AUVs report to, there they get allocated their individual task
                which will then be carried out efficiently and no AUVs will interfere with eachother. This
                mean each robot will collect plastic from its own area and take it to be recycled and when
                done on scale this will be great in reducing the plastic in our ocean.</p>
            <p> While in tests and simulations this solution looks like a great way to reduce the quantitiy of
                plastic in our ocean, currently the technology in the AUVs is not quite advanced enough yet
                “there are no powerful underwater robots designed for cleaning marine plastics in the
                market.” (Hong, Cui and Chen, 2021) . So once the technology has been developed, this
                looks like an area which will make an impact on the oceans plastics.</p>
            <h1>Monitoring biodiversity</h1>
            <p>Computing is also playing a major role in the monitoring of marine biodiversity, this is
                important for our climate as the species diversity and the abundance of a species tells us a lot
                about the conditions of an environment. The problems with this monitoring until recently is
                the sheer scale of the ocean and the amount of data that can be collected.
                AI is very important in this field of monitoring marine life because there is no real feasible
                manual way to do it. With this knowledge, “researchers have been working to build
                monitoring solutions for automatic identification, classification and prediction using AI
                algorithms.”(Jiang and Zhu, 2022) and with these models created it will make it so other
                researchers will be able to search for data way easier as data will be recorded and presented
                in a useable format.</p>
            <p> This data will make it so scientists can go look in depth at specific species and see why they
                are either thriving or failing to adapt to their changing climates. This gives a better
                understanding of the things we should be worried about happening at scale in our oceans
                making it hard for ocean life to continue as it is.</p>
            <p> The oceans of the world take up over 70% of our planet and it seems like many do not care
                about the effects of climate change on it. We need to continue to look for solutions with the
                advancement of technology which will help to slow down the effects of climate change in the
                short term and figure out the ways to stop the world from hitting a point of no return. While
                the solutions brought up in this section will not completely change the direction that our
                world is heading in, they will will play a role in bettering our planets ecosystems, giving
                more time for more research to be done and other solutions to be found.
