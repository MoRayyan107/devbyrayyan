            Launched on July 15, 2004, <b>AURA</b> is an Earth Science satellite owned 
            and operated by <b>NASA</b>. Although it was only intended to last six years,
            it has been in use for more than 15 years. As a component of the global 
            <b><u>Observing System (EOS)</u></b> constellation of spacecraft, the Aura mission 
            investigates the dynamics and chemistry of Earth's atmosphere from the 
            mesosphere to the surface.

            The <b>OMI</b> (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) is a type of instrument which 
            is installed in Aura (Spacecraft by NASA) which looks straight

          NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, oversaw the science 
          investigations, launch, and instrumentation of the <b>EOS Aura satellite</b>. The satellite 
          was intended to stay in operation for at least five years when it was launched in <b>July 
          2004</b>. Among the scientific payloads were:

          With a spectral resolution of roughly 0.5 nm and a swath 
          width of 2600 km, the <b>OMI</b> instrument on board Aura is a 
          <b>nadir-viewing Ultraviolet/Visible spectrophotometry imaging</b> 
          spectrograph that measures the solar radiation backscattered 
          by Earth's atmosphere and surface over the entire wavelength 
          range from 270 to 500 nm. The Finnish Meteorological Institute 
          (FMI) and the <br><b>Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes (NIVR)</b> 
          collaborated to provide OMI.
