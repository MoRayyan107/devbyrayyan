            The <b><u>GOME-2</u></b> is a new generation instrument to map concentrations of atmospheric ozone and other 
            trace gases for use in weather forecasting, air-quality monitoring, and atmospheric research. 
            GOME-2 is a <b>scanning spectrometer</b> that captures the reflected light from the earth's surface and 
            atmosphere. In just matter of seconds, each scan across the satellite track is completed and, 
            in a day, it is dedicated of achieving a global coverage of scan width of 1920 km.

            GOME-2 Observes four times smaller ground pixels, and has better polarisation and has improved its 
            calibrations. Using the principles of Spectroscopy, involving the splitting of light into its natural components 
            by using advanced tools like telescope, prisms, and gratings to reveal the absorption lines which 
            remarks its gases under the observation of GOME-2 which is able to calculate the number of different 
            gases present in the atmosphere.

          Before the light is directed towards a quartz prism, which divides the light into four main beams, it is reflected by several mirrors. 
          Holographic gratings further split the four beams so that the light can be resolved to wavelengths of at least 0.5 nm.
