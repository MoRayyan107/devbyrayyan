                <p>
                    Overall, the group was able to discuss potential ideas at the start of the project and was able to meet the previous deadlines, so that 
                    we were already prepared for the last stage of the group project. For the lab session (18th October 2023), we outlined the home page,
                    references and review pages; drawing potential layouts for the website. Then we talked about potential meetups where we could discuss 
                    where we are currently at the project and rundown all the tasks that we still had to complete. We met up at Sunday to discuss  
                    how much we have done and how we could improve on the website. Our group did not have a team leader who would assign the roles that
                    each member had to do, which I believe was the correct way in handling this project as it allowed everyone to get comfortable with what 
                    they wanted to do, instead of forcing a person a task where they might not feel confident in completing it. As we had each guy assign 
                    their own jobs, we are able to produce an excellent quality work to the best of our ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of roles, we did not formally assign each other roles and rather did our own thing, but apart from the individual webpages, Russell was assgined
                    to do the references page, Fraser did the home page and css layout and then I was assigned to do the review page. While we did not assign roles in 
                    our group, I saw that each member showed different characteristics related to Belbin's team roles: Fraser as the specialist, Russell as the co-ordinator,
                    Mohammad as the implementer, Kyle as the teamworker and Jack as the completer finisher. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that we worked effectively as a team given that we were able to clearly lay out all the major deadlines that we had to complete for the
                    project and that we completed all of your assigned deadlines so that we had enough time to check and review our website. During our discussions, everyone 
                    had their chance to bring forward something that could be useful towards the project.
