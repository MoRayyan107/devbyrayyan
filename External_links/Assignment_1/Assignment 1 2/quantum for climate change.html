Quantum computing is a field within computer science that uses principles of quantum theory (which explains the behaviour of certain types of energy)  
<br>Quantum computing uses subatomic particles, such as electrons and photons, Quantum bits (qubits) allow these particles to exist in more than one state e.g., 1 AND 0 simultaneously.
<br>Simply put, quantum computers do not have the same restrictions that classic computer possess as they are not bonded by 1’s and 0’s in a binary manner. 
<br>As a result of this they can perform calculations that might have ether wise taken millions of years, the human race do not have a million years to take significant action against climate change so quantum computers may be a necessary ally.

<i><b>"Quantum technology gives us all an opportunity to reconceptualize the ways we manufacture, travel and 
consume so we can contribute toward protecting our environment. And there’s no need to wait another 10 
years to do it"</i></b>

QC presents the opportunity to tackle climate change issues in new, innovative ways by opening up possibilities in many different fields.
Quantum technology may transform the energy industry and lead to cleaner energy and fewer emissions. Some ways that the energy industry could be revolutionised are: 
<ul>
<li>Finding favourable locations for wind and solar farms so their efficiency can be optimised.</li>
<li>New sources of renewable energy may be found by running advanced simulations to test the energy production and the efficiency of new materials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning</h2>

Machine learning has greatly increased the efficiency of an array of applications, including eco-friendly chemical synthesis and various renewable energy systems.
Unfortunately though, there are certain obstacles placed in the path of Machine learning that detract from its potential for tackling especially complex climate issues.
However, one positive has emerged, this being that some Quantum computing techniques look as if they may be able to provide support to machine learning and remove a large amount of these obstacles from the path.
Quantum computing has the capability to improve machine learning by enhancing the speed of tasks that previously would’ve required a large amount of computations, this leads to the improved process of ‘quantum-enhanced machine learning’ (QML).  
Just one example is there have been studies that suggest that with the help of Quantum Machine Learning it will become much easier to accurately predict air pollution."(Ajagekar, A. and You, F. (2022))

<h2>Strengthening security of sensitive data</h2>

Quantum computing also has the power to enhance the security of communication and data storage, 
which is vital for safeguarding sensitive climate-related data and preventing cyberattacks being launched upon critical infrastructure.
